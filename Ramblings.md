While learning about Grover's algorithm, I came across the "reflection" operator. It was simply stated as $`2\ket{s}\bra{s} - I`$.
But there was no derivation shown. Perhaps this is a simple one for Physics major but for me this was a bit unsatisfying unless I could derive it. Internet search including ChatGPT and Copilot was futile. Google Gemini did a bit better but far from satisfying. Hence the derivation and this may help other.

**Projection Operator:**
Projection of a ket $`\ket{p}`$ on to another ket $`\ket{s}`$ is $`\ket{s}\braket{s|p}`$. This simplifies to $`\alpha\ket{s}`$, where $`\alpha = \braket{s|p}`$. Clearly, this is the component of $`\ket{p}`$ on  $`\ket{s}`$.
